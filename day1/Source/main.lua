myGameSetUp()

-- `playdate.update()` is the heart of every Playdate game.
-- This function is called right before every frame is drawn onscreen.
-- Use this function to poll input, run game logic, and move sprites.

function playdate.update()

    -- Poll the d-pad and move our player accordingly.
    -- (There are multiple ways to read the d-pad; this is the simplest.)
    -- Note that it is possible for more than one of these directions
    -- to be pressed at once, if the user is pressing diagonally.

    end

    -- Call the functions below in playdate.update() to draw sprites and keep
    -- timers updated. (We aren't using timers in this example, but in most
    -- average-complexity games, you will.)

    gfx.sprite.update()
    playdate.timer.updateTimers()
