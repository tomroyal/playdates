# Playdates

I'm learning to code simple games for the [Playdate](https://play.date) console in Lua, and documenting the process step by step.

This repo holds every stage of my demo game, as it develops each day, with all the assets I create.

There's an explanation for every day on my website here: https://tomroyal.com/category/playdate/
